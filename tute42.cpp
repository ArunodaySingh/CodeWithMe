//Exercise on C++ Inheritance

// Create 2 classes:
//     1. Simple Calculator-> Takes input of 2 number using utility function 
//        and perform +,-,*,/ and display it's result
//     2. Scientific Calculator-> Takes input of 2 number using a utility fucntion and four scientific operations of your choices and displays
//                                 the results using another fucntion.

//      Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using there 2 classes
//     1. What type of Inheritence are you using?
//     2. Which mode of Inheritence are you using?
//     3. Create an object of HybridCalculator and display result of simple and 
//        scientific calculator.
//     4. How is code reusability implementation.
