// The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
/*
-> Competitive Programming mein hko
->>>>Resize
->>>>sort
->>>>Search etc..

-> It can be easy if you're using STL

Present all these library in STL (Standard Template Library)
Library of what -> Generic Classes and Functions which use for time savings.

Why use STL -> Reuse: Well tested Componenets

HP company two employee [Alex , Mergily] kuch component aur function
ko ek saath rkhna start kia tbse STL grow hi kerti rah gyi.

Components of STL=>
Containers -> Store data use template classes(prebuilt) for eg(Vector ) etc..
Algorithms -> [Sorting , Searching , Merging ] use template functions.
Iterators -> It's a object points to an element in a Containers like a pointer.
             Algorithms ko Containers ka saath connect kerta hai


STL is used because it's not good idea to reinvent the wheel
