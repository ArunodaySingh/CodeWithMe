// Inheritance & Its Different Types with Examples in C++

/*
This is the concept of OOPs
Reusibility is a very Famous Feature of OOPs
In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional feature to it
Reusing classes saves time and money.
Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort
of developing and debugging the same thing again.
-> The concept of Reusability in c++ is supporrted using inheritence
-> We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheritence from it
-> The existing class is called the Base Class
-> The new class which is inherited is class as the Derived Class
-> Different types of inheritence.
------> Single Inheritence(one base one derived)
------> Multiple Inheritence(multiple base one derived)
------> Multilevel Inheritence(one base one derived(base for next class))
------> Heirarichal Inheritence(one base multiple derived)
------> Hybrid Inheritence (Combination of Multiple Inheritence and Multilevel Inheritence)
